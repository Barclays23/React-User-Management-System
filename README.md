📋 Prerequisites

Node.js (v16.x or higher)
npm (v8.x or higher)
MongoDB Atlas account
Cloudinary account


🛠️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
# Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Set up the backend:

Navigate to the backend folder:cd backend


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env file in the backend/ directory using the template provided in the Environment Variables section below and fill in your credentials.


Set up the frontend:

Navigate to the frontend folder:cd ../frontend


Install dependencies:npm install




Start the servers:

Start the backend server (in one terminal):cd backend
npm run dev


Start the frontend server (in another terminal):cd frontend
npm start



Note: The application will be available at:

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:5000

Important: Ensure MongoDB Atlas and Cloudinary accounts are set up, and their credentials are added to the .env file before starting the servers.



⚙️ Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend/ directory with the following template and fill in your credentials:
# App Environment
NODE_ENV=development
# NODE_ENV=production

# Super Admin Email
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@gmail.com

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secrets
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>

# Server Port
PORT=5000

Important: Add backend/.env to your .gitignore file to prevent sensitive information from being committed. Example .gitignore:
node_modules/
backend/.env
frontend/build/


🚀 Deployment
To deploy the application, use platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Render. Follow these steps:

Backend Deployment:

Deploy the backend/ folder to a Node.js-compatible platform (e.g., Heroku, Render).
Set up environment variables on the platform’s dashboard (same as in .env).
Ensure MongoDB Atlas and Cloudinary are accessible from the deployed server.


Frontend Deployment:

Build the React app:cd frontend
npm run build


Deploy the build/ folder to a static hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
Configure the hosting service to serve the static files.


Connect Frontend and Backend:

Update the frontend’s API base URL (e.g., in frontend/src/config.js or frontend environment variables) to point to the deployed backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend-url.com/api).



Note: Detailed deployment guides for specific platforms will be added soon.

🧪 Running Tests
To run tests for the backend:
cd backend
npm test

To run tests for the frontend:
cd frontend
npm test

Note: Testing setup is currently in progress and will be added soon.

🛠️ Troubleshooting

MongoDB Connection Error: Ensure your MONGO_URI is correct and your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas.
Cloudinary Upload Fails: Verify your Cloudinary credentials (CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET).
Port Already in Use: Change the PORT in the .env file or stop the conflicting process.


🤝 Contributing
